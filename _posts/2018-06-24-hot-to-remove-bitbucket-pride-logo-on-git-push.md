**TLDR;** Go to account settings and turn the ```Console [] Enable console messages``` off.

Couple of days ago I was surprized to see this rainbow (pride) Bitbucket logo in a terminal when I pushed the commit to my repository.

![Bitbucket pride Logo on git push]({{site.baseurl}}/_posts/bitbucket-pride-logo.png)

After some reasearch I found [this](https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Bitbucket-discussions/Do-we-really-need-ascii-art-in-a-push-response/td-p/599644) thread where was explanation that by this

> Atlassian supports equality, including the global LGBT population

which is great, I fully agree with equality, but not when it appears without my permision and hide a full screen of terminal history. So in order to keep your terminal clean, you should go to your account settings and turn the option `Enable console messages` off.

Hope it helped and happy coding!
