Hey everyone! First off, **sorry for not posting regularly**. As you might
guess, I also have ADHD, and sometimes it’s tough to get started—even on
things I care about. But here I am, finally getting this out to you, and I
hope it helps.

Over the past two years of using Elvanse (lisdexamfetamine), I’ve learned a
lot about how to make this medication work best for me. After tons of
research, talking to others in the ADHD community, and working closely with my
healthcare provider, I’ve gathered some tips that have made a real difference.
**But remember, everyone’s experience is different** —what works for me might
not be the best for you. So, use these tips as a guide, but always listen to
your body and consult with your doctor.

    **Disclaimer:** These are personal experiences and insights. Please consult a healthcare provider for advice tailored to your situation. I’m not responsible if someone misapplies these tips and experiences negative effects.

## **Do:**

### **Eat a Protein-Rich Meal Before Taking Elvanse**

Elvanse can suppress your appetite, leading to potential energy crashes and
increased anxiety if you’re not properly fueled. Starting your day with a
protein-rich meal stabilizes your blood sugar and provides a steady source of
energy throughout the day. Protein is also crucial for neurotransmitter
function, particularly dopamine, which is essential for focus and attention.
By supporting dopamine production, a protein-rich diet can help you maximize
the benefits of Elvanse while minimizing side effects like jitteriness and
anxiety.

### **Stay Hydrated**

Proper hydration is vital when taking Elvanse, as dehydration can worsen
common side effects such as dry mouth, headaches, and fatigue. Drinking enough
water helps maintain cognitive function and supports cardiovascular health,
which is particularly important when using stimulant medications. Staying
hydrated ensures that your body functions optimally, allowing the medication
to work effectively without unnecessary discomfort.

### **Be Cautious with Caffeine**

Both Elvanse and caffeine are stimulants, and when combined, they can lead to
heightened anxiety, jitteriness, and an increased heart rate. Managing your
caffeine intake or eliminating it can prevent these uncomfortable side
effects. Caffeine amplifies the stimulant effects of Elvanse, which can
overstimulate the central nervous system and lead to an overwhelming sense of
unease. By reducing caffeine, you allow Elvanse to do its job more effectively
and with fewer complications.

### **Use the Initial Boost to Build Routines**

The initial period after starting Elvanse often comes with a significant boost
in focus and motivation, making it an ideal time to establish new habits and
routines. Creating a structure during this time helps you maintain progress
even as the medication’s effects stabilize. Habit formation during periods of
high motivation can lead to long-lasting behavioral changes, providing a
strong foundation for managing ADHD symptoms in the long term.

### **Move Your Body: Stretch, Exercise, or Practice Yoga**

Physical activity, including stretching, exercise, or yoga, is essential for
counteracting the restlessness that can accompany stimulant use. Regular
movement not only alleviates physical discomfort but also improves cognitive
function and mood, which are critical for managing ADHD. Exercise enhances
executive function, reduces ADHD symptoms, and supports overall well-being,
making it an important complement to Elvanse.

### **Keep a Sleep Routine**

Elvanse can interfere with sleep, particularly if taken too late in the day.
Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule helps ensure you get the rest needed
to manage ADHD symptoms. Adequate sleep is crucial for cognitive health, and
sleep disturbances can exacerbate ADHD, making good sleep hygiene essential
for effective treatment.

### **Journal Your Journey**

Keeping a journal of your experiences with Elvanse helps track how the
medication affects you, monitor side effects, and make informed decisions with
your healthcare provider. Journaling increases self-awareness and improves
communication with your doctor, leading to better treatment outcomes. It
allows you to see patterns and adjust your approach as needed, ensuring that
you get the most out of your medication.

## **Don’t:**

### **Avoid Alcohol and High Doses of Vitamin C**

Alcohol can intensify the stimulant effects of Elvanse, leading to increased
anxiety and disrupted sleep, while high doses of Vitamin C can interfere with
the medication’s absorption, reducing its effectiveness. Both alcohol and
Vitamin C can negatively interact with Elvanse, either by enhancing side
effects or diminishing the medication’s efficacy. Avoiding these substances
ensures that Elvanse can work as intended without unnecessary interference.

### **Don’t Mess with Your Dosage**

It might be tempting to increase your dose on challenging days, but doing so
without medical supervision can lead to serious side effects, including
heightened anxiety, cardiovascular issues, and the risk of dependency.
Stimulant medications like Elvanse require careful dosage management to avoid
adverse effects. Any changes to your dosage should always be made under the
guidance of a healthcare provider.

### **Be Cautious with Serotonin-Enhancing Supplements**

Combining Elvanse with serotonin-enhancing supplements like 5-HTP can lead to
serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. Always consult
your doctor before adding new supplements or medications to your regimen.
Serotonin syndrome is a serious risk when combining stimulants with substances
that increase serotonin levels, so caution is crucial.

### **Give Yourself Time to Adjust**

The first few weeks on Elvanse can be challenging as your body adapts to the
medication. Side effects like appetite loss and anxiety often diminish over
time, so it’s important to be patient during this adjustment period. Many side
effects associated with stimulant medications decrease as the body acclimates,
leading to a more stable and beneficial experience as you continue the
treatment.

## Common Side Effects of Elvanse and Solutions

When I first began my journey with Elvanse to manage ADHD, I was both hopeful
and a little apprehensive. Like many who start a new medication, I wasn’t sure
what to expect, and the possibility of side effects was always in the back of
my mind. Over time, though, I’ve come to understand that while side effects
can be a part of the process, they don’t have to define your experience. I’ve
learned that with a little patience and some mindful adjustments to my daily
routine, it’s possible to navigate these challenges and still reap the
benefits of the medication.

### Appetite Suppression and Weight Loss

One of the most frequent side effects of Elvanse is appetite suppression,
which can lead to unintended weight loss. This happens because the stimulant
can dull your hunger cues, making it easy to skip meals without realizing it.
To mitigate this, it’s important to start your day with a protein-rich
breakfast before taking your medication. Protein helps stabilize blood sugar
levels, keeping your energy consistent throughout the day. Additionally, even
if you don’t feel hungry, try to eat small, nutrient-dense snacks regularly to
maintain your weight and energy.

### Insomnia or Trouble Sleeping

Elvanse is a stimulant, so it can interfere with your sleep, especially if you
take it later in the day. To avoid insomnia, it’s best to take your dose early
in the morning. Creating a consistent bedtime routine that prioritizes good
sleep hygiene—such as reducing screen time before bed, keeping your sleeping
environment dark and cool, and winding down with relaxing activities—can also
help. If you find that sleep issues persist, it’s worth discussing with your
doctor, as they might adjust your dosage or the timing of your medication.

### Dry Mouth

Experiencing dry mouth is another common side effect when taking Elvanse. This
can be uncomfortable, but staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water
throughout the day can help alleviate it. Additionally, chewing sugar-free gum
or sucking on sugar-free candies can stimulate saliva production, offering
some relief from dry mouth.

### Headaches

Headaches can occur, particularly when you first start taking Elvanse. These
headaches may be related to dehydration or low blood sugar levels. To prevent
them, make sure you’re drinking enough water and not skipping meals. If
headaches become persistent, it’s important to consult with your healthcare
provider, who might suggest adjusting your dosage or exploring other
solutions.

## Jitteriness or Feeling Overstimulated

Some people might feel jittery or overstimulated after taking Elvanse. This
can be unsettling, but regular physical activity, like walking or stretching,
can help manage these sensations. Exercise helps expend excess energy, reduces
anxiety, and generally improves mood, making it easier to handle the
stimulating effects of the medication. Incorporating relaxation techniques,
such as deep breathing or meditation, into your daily routine can also help
calm your nervous system and reduce these feelings.

### Irritability and Mood Swings

Elvanse can sometimes cause irritability or mood swings, especially when your
body is still adjusting to the medication. To manage these emotional
fluctuations, focus on maintaining a balanced diet, getting regular exercise,
and ensuring you have a consistent sleep schedule. If mood swings persist,
it’s essential to talk to your doctor. They might adjust your dosage or
suggest complementary therapies to help stabilize your mood.

### Nausea or Stomach Discomfort

Nausea or stomach discomfort can occur, particularly if you take Elvanse on an
empty stomach. To reduce the likelihood of these symptoms, take your
medication with food or immediately after a meal. Eating smaller, more
frequent meals throughout the day can also help manage any stomach discomfort.

By addressing these side effects proactively, you can improve your overall
experience with Elvanse and better manage your ADHD symptoms. Always keep in
close contact with your healthcare provider, especially if you encounter
persistent or severe side effects. They can adjust your treatment plan to
better suit your needs, ensuring that your ADHD management remains effective
and comfortable.

## **Personal Notes and Final Thoughts**

**Taking Breaks:** Personally, I don’t take Elvanse every day. Skipping a day
here and there helps keep the medication effective at the same dose and
prevents me from becoming too reliant on it. However, this approach isn’t for
everyone. Some people need to take it consistently to avoid severe side
effects when restarting, so make sure to discuss this with your doctor before
trying it out.

**Recognizing Off-Days:** Even with Elvanse, there are days when I simply
can’t get anything done. Sometimes, this means I might need a dose adjustment,
but often it just means it’s not the day to push myself. On those days, I let
myself rest or do something enjoyable. The next day, I usually feel much more
productive.

**Remember:** These tips are drawn from my personal experience and research.
They’ve helped me navigate the ups and downs of managing ADHD with Elvanse,
and I hope they can be helpful to you as well. However, everyone’s journey is
unique, so it’s crucial to work closely with your healthcare provider to find
what works best for you. Always prioritize your health and well-being, and
don’t hesitate to reach out to me for professional advice when needed.

## P.S. Important Safety Note:

Please be aware that Elvanse (lisdexamfetamine) is a stimulant medication, and
its use comes with significant responsibilities. It’s important to recognize
that this medication is still banned in some countries due to its stimulant
properties. This article is not a recommendation to use stimulants without
proper medical oversight. Always use this medication under the strict guidance
of a healthcare provider and only with a valid prescription.

Before starting Elvanse, ensure you undergo the necessary health checks and
maintain regular appointments with your doctor. Pay close attention to any
urges to increase your dosage on your own, as individuals with ADHD are more
susceptible to developing unhealthy habits. Never adjust your dosage without
having an open and honest conversation with your healthcare provider. Your
safety and well-being should always come first.
