For much of my life, I struggled to find peace amidst the chaos of my
thoughts, behaviours, and emotions. It wasn't until I was diagnosed with ADHD
at the age of 30 that I began to comprehend the reasons behind my impulsivity
and restlessness. However, before this diagnosis, I tried various coping
mechanisms—obsessive sports, shisha, sex, cannabis, and recreational
drugs—each providing temporary relief but ultimately intensifying my
struggles. In this article, we will explore the relationship between ADHD and
substance use, informed by both personal experience and the latest scientific
research.

## **The Dangers of Substance Use in ADHD**

Individuals with ADHD face a significantly heightened risk of developing
Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) compared to those without the disorder. This
vulnerability is deeply rooted in the unique neurobiological and psychological
characteristics of ADHD, making the connection between ADHD and substance use
a complex and multifaceted issue.

### **Increased Susceptibility and Prevalence**

Research consistently shows that individuals with ADHD are more likely to
engage in substance use at an earlier age and are at a higher risk of
developing dependencies. For instance, people with ADHD are approximately
twice as likely to use nicotine throughout their lives, three times more
likely to develop a dependency on nicotine during adolescence or adulthood,
and twice as likely to misuse alcohol or become dependent on it. These
statistics highlight the broader trend of increased substance use among
individuals with ADHD, a pattern that is evident across various types of
substances, including illegal drugs.

### **The Role of Impulsivity and Risk-Seeking Behaviour**

One of the key factors contributing to this increased susceptibility is the
impulsivity and risk-seeking behaviour that are hallmark features of ADHD.
Individuals with ADHD often exhibit higher levels of impulsivity, which can
lead to experimentation with substances without fully considering the
potential consequences. This impulsivity is not just a matter of spontaneous
decision-making; it is closely tied to the brain’s reward system, which is
often dysregulated in those with ADHD. The desire for immediate gratification,
combined with reduced sensitivity to the potential negative outcomes of risky
behaviour, makes individuals with ADHD particularly prone to substance use.

This pattern is further compounded by the inherent craving for novelty and
stimulation that many people with ADHD experience. Substances such as
nicotine, alcohol, and drugs often provide the quick reward and immediate
relief from boredom or restlessness that those with ADHD seek. However, this
short-term relief can quickly lead to dependency, as the brain begins to
associate substance use with the regulation of ADHD symptoms, creating a
dangerous cycle.

### **Self-Medication and the Search for Relief**

The concept of self-medication plays a significant role in the relationship
between ADHD and substance use. Many individuals with ADHD turn to substances
in an attempt to manage their symptoms, particularly those related to
hyperactivity, inattention, and emotional dysregulation. For instance,
nicotine is often used for its stimulant effects, which can temporarily
enhance focus and reduce hyperactivity—two common challenges faced by
individuals with ADHD. Similarly, alcohol might be used to calm the mind or
reduce social anxiety, while other substances might be employed to mitigate
the stress and frustration that often accompany the disorder.

However, while these substances might offer temporary relief, they do so at a
significant cost. The effects of substances like nicotine and alcohol are
fleeting, leading to repeated use and, over time, dependency. Furthermore, the
self-medication hypothesis is complicated by the fact that substances can
exacerbate the very symptoms they are used to manage. For example, while
alcohol may temporarily reduce hyperactivity, its depressive effects can
worsen mood regulation issues in the long term, leading to increased
impulsivity and further substance use.

### **The Need for Awareness and Intervention**

Given the heightened risk of substance use disorders among individuals with
ADHD, there is a critical need for increased awareness and early intervention.
Parents, educators, and healthcare providers must be vigilant in recognizing
the signs of substance use and understanding the unique risks faced by those
with ADHD. Early implementation of preventative strategies, such as
psychoeducation and behavioural interventions, can play a crucial role in
reducing the incidence of substance use disorders in this population.

Furthermore, treatment for ADHD should incorporate a holistic approach that
considers the potential for substance use. This may include the use of non-
stimulant medications, behavioural therapies, and ongoing support to help
individuals manage their symptoms without turning to substances. It is also
essential for those with ADHD to have access to resources and support systems
that can help them navigate the challenges of living with the disorder while
minimizing the risk of substance use.

## The Role of Self-Medication and Binge Behaviours

Self-medication is a common coping mechanism for those with ADHD. For
instance, I turned to cannabis to manage my anxiety, but what initially seemed
like a solution eventually became another problem, leading to dependency and
increased anxiety. This pattern is not unique to me; many individuals with
ADHD find that substances which temporarily alleviate symptoms often
exacerbate them over time.

Recent research has expanded our understanding of how ADHD intersects with
substance use and other compulsive behaviours such as binge eating and binge-
watching. Binge eating is particularly prevalent among individuals with ADHD,
affecting roughly 30% of those with the disorder. This behaviour is often
linked to the same dopamine dysregulation that underlies ADHD, driving the
need for immediate gratification and reward [#chadd2018] [#javaras2024].

Similarly, binge-watching has become an increasingly recognised coping
mechanism, offering a temporary escape from daily stresses. However, this
behaviour can lead to a cycle of avoidance and worsened symptoms. A recent
survey highlighted that nearly half of those struggling with mental health
issues, including ADHD, resort to binge-watching as an unhealthy coping
strategy [#myriad2023].

## Recognising the Signs of Addiction

Identifying when substance use has crossed into addiction is crucial. The
signs can be subtle: using substances more frequently, needing larger amounts
to achieve the same effect, or struggling to cut back despite wanting to. For
me, the realisation came when I found myself reaching for cannabis not just to
relax, but because I felt I couldn’t function without it. This was a
significant wake-up call—one that I’m still navigating.

This behaviour aligns with the broader understanding of addiction, where the
brain's reward system becomes increasingly dependent on external substances to
maintain normal functioning. The shift from occasional use to dependency can
be gradual, making it essential to recognise early warning signs before the
behaviour becomes entrenched [#nida2024].

### Finding Better Ways to Heal

While these coping mechanisms provided temporary relief, they also led me down
a path of greater challenges. It wasn’t until I began to explore healthier
ways to manage my ADHD that I found more sustainable solutions. Therapy,
particularly Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Dialectical behaviour
therapy (DBT) and mindfulness practices became integral in helping me address
the root causes of my anxiety and impulsivity. Regular physical activity,
which once bordered on obsession, is now a balanced part of my life (when I am
not too focused on work), providing a healthy outlet for my energy.

Medication also played a crucial role. Discovering that ADHD medications like
Elvanse (lisdexamfetamine) could help manage my symptoms without the highs and
lows associated with self-medication was transformative.

The importance of finding healthier ways to cope with ADHD cannot be
overstated. Engaging in therapies that teach stress management and emotional
regulation can lead to long-term benefits, reducing the reliance on substances
or compulsive behaviours to cope with life's challenges. Research consistently
shows that a combination of medication and therapy is the most effective
treatment for ADHD, particularly when it comes to managing symptoms and
preventing relapse into unhealthy coping mechanisms [#nimh2024].

## Neurobiology and Treatment

The neurobiological underpinnings of ADHD and its associated
behaviours—substance use, binge eating, and binge-watching—are intricate. ADHD
is characterised by dysregulation in the brain's dopamine pathways, which are
crucial for reward processing and impulse control. This dysregulation not only
increases the risk of substance use but also makes individuals more
susceptible to other addictive behaviours. Research has shown that the same
neurobiological mechanisms that make individuals with ADHD more prone to
substance use also contribute to the development of other compulsive
behaviours, such as binge eating and watching [#nimh2024].

Recent studies have revealed that binge eating is not as transient as once
believed, with many individuals experiencing it for years after the initial
diagnosis. This finding underscores the importance of early and sustained
intervention for better outcomes. Interestingly, medications traditionally
used to treat ADHD, such as lisdexamfetamine (Elvanse), have shown promise in
treating binge eating disorder, offering a dual benefit for those grappling
with both conditions [#javaras2024].

Understanding these neurobiological connections is crucial for developing
effective treatments that address the underlying causes of both ADHD and its
associated behaviours. By targeting the dopamine pathways involved in reward
processing and impulse control, new treatments can offer hope to those
struggling with these interconnected issues [#nimh2024].

## Seeking Help and Building a Support System

If you're struggling with substance use and ADHD, know that you are not alone.
Seeking help from a doctor or mental health professional can be the first step
toward reclaiming control. Organisations such as CHADD [#chadd-main] provide resources and
support, both online and in person, to help navigate these challenges.

Building a support system is vital for long-term success. Engaging with
therapy, joining support groups, and involving family members in the treatment
process can provide the necessary encouragement and accountability to stay on
track. Research has shown that individuals with strong social support networks
are more likely to achieve and maintain recovery from substance use disorders,
particularly when these networks involve supportive family and friends who
understand the challenges of living with ADHD [#samhsa2024].

## Conclusion: The Path Forward

The relationship between ADHD and substance use, along with other compulsive
behaviours like binge eating and watching, is both complex and deeply
personal. For those of us navigating these challenges, understanding the
neurobiological factors at play and seeking comprehensive treatment can make
all the difference. While the journey is ongoing and fraught with challenges,
it’s possible to find healthier, more effective ways to manage ADHD and its
associated behaviours.
