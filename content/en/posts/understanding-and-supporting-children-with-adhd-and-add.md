When I was a child, my parents didn’t know what ADHD (Attention-
Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) or ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) were. Back
then, there were no resources available to help us understand and manage these
conditions. Many children, including myself, had to find ways to adapt and
work with our challenges on our own.

Today, we know more about what ADHD and ADD are and how crucial it is to
provide the right support for children with these disorders. ADHD and ADD are
neurobiological disorders linked to dysfunction in certain areas of the brain
responsible for attention, self-control, and planning. Research shows that
children with ADHD have reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex, making it
difficult for them to concentrate and control impulses.

Additionally, children with ADHD often struggle with a lack of time perception
and difficulty in seeing far-fetched goals. This means they may have trouble
estimating how long tasks will take, leading to challenges in time management
and planning for the future. These difficulties can significantly impact their
academic performance and daily life, making targeted support and interventions
essential.

However, in many countries, these problems are still not always taken
seriously. Many parents and teachers do not know how to properly support
children with ADHD, leading to difficulties at school and home.

## **Understanding ADHD and ADD**

It is important to remember that there is not only ADHD, where children are
hyperactive but also ADD, where children do not exhibit hyperactivity but
still experience significant difficulties with attention and organization.
Such children may appear dreamy or lazy, but in reality, they struggle with
invisible obstacles that prevent them from focusing and effectively completing
tasks.

## **General Support Methods for Children with ADHD and ADD**

### **Creating Structure and Routine**

**Consistent Daily Routine** : Establishing a clear schedule helps children
with ADHD feel secure and understand what is expected of them. A structured
environment reduces stress levels and helps children better manage daily
tasks.

**Visual Aids** : Using pictures, schedules, and visual reminders can help
children navigate their activities and tasks. For example, a visual schedule
on the refrigerator can remind a child about homework and other
responsibilities.

### **Positive Reinforcement**

**Praise and Rewards** : Positive reinforcement for good behaviour and task
completion can encourage children to repeat these behaviours. For example, you
can use a reward system for completing homework or household chores.

**Small Steps and Goals** : Breaking down large tasks into small, manageable
steps helps children avoid feeling overwhelmed. Celebrating small successes
maintains motivation and self-confidence.

### **Emotional Support and Understanding**

**Empathy and Understanding** : It is important to show children that you
understand their difficulties and support them in overcoming these challenges.
This fosters trust and improves self-esteem.

**Therapeutic Support** : Consulting a psychologist or therapist can help
children manage their emotions and develop coping strategies. Support groups
for parents can also be beneficial.

## **Attention to Social and Academic Aspects**

### **School Age (7-12 years)**

When children start school, attention problems become more noticeable. They
may have trouble organizing tasks, completing homework, and following multi-
step instructions.

**Example** : Maria, a 9-year-old girl, often forgets to write down her
homework assignments and turns in incomplete, messy work.

#### **Support Methods** :

• **Individualized Education Programs (IEPs)** : These programs can include
extra time on tests, breaks during classes, and the use of technology for
organizing schoolwork.

• **Breaking Tasks into Smaller Steps** : Dividing large tasks into manageable
steps helps children like Maria complete assignments more effectively.

• **Social Skills Training** : Programs that teach children how to interact
appropriately with classmates can improve their social relationships.

### **Adolescence (13-18 years)**

In adolescence, hyperactivity may decrease, but problems with attention and
impulsivity often persist. Teens may face academic challenges due to poor time
management and organization. They are also at higher risk for engaging in
risky behaviours and may struggle with self-esteem.

**Example** : Alex, a 16-year-old teenager, often procrastinates on his
assignments and has trouble meeting deadlines.

#### **Support Methods** :

• **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** : CBT can help teens develop
strategies for managing impulsive behaviour and improving organizational
skills.

• **Parental Involvement** : Educating parents about ADHD can enable them to
support their children more effectively. Support groups and counselling
provide additional resources and strategies.

• **Setting Realistic Goals** : Helping teens set achievable goals and
providing frequent feedback and rewards can maintain their motivation and
focus.

## **Why Criticism and Punishment Don’t Work**

When I was a child, my relatives often called me lazy. Regardless of my
achievements, I was constantly told that if I tried harder, I would achieve
more. These words undermined my self-esteem, and over time, I began to feel
“defective.” My forgetfulness became a family joke. When it came to homework,
I could spend hours in my room, playing with a pen or staring at the wall,
instead of studying. Punishments only killed my motivation, and I ended up
studying only in the last couple of weeks before exams when stress and
adrenaline helped me focus and get everything done.

Criticism, coercion, and attempts to force children with ADHD to complete
tasks immediately often lead to negative outcomes. These methods cause
children significant stress and anxiety, which impairs their ability to
concentrate and complete tasks. Research shows that negative parenting methods
exacerbate ADHD symptoms and lead to worsening behaviour [#senmagazine2024] [#sciencedaily2017]. According to
studies, children who are subjected to criticism and punishment are more
likely to experience higher levels of anxiety and depression.

In the article by Eileen Bailey [#healthcentral2024], the author discusses how punishment alone is
typically ineffective for children with ADHD. This is because traditional
punishment assumes that the child intentionally engaged in misbehaviour and
that the consequence will prevent future occurrences. However, when children
with ADHD misbehave, it is often due to impulsiveness or inattention. These
behaviours are not the result of willful disobedience but rather a failure to
manage ADHD symptoms, likely because the child has not yet developed the
necessary skills.

**Example** : Olga, a 10-year-old girl, frequently receives negative comments
from her parents for not completing her homework. Instead of improving her
behaviour, this leads to increased anxiety and a further decline in academic
performance.

### **What to do instead**

1\. **Positive Reinforcement and Support** : Studies show that positive
reinforcement is much more effective in managing the behaviour of children
with ADHD than criticism and punishment [#breaz2024] [#ibcces2024]. Positive reinforcement helps children
feel confident and motivated.

2\. **Supportive Environment** : Positive feedback and support improve
emotional and academic development. Children who receive support are better
able to cope with difficulties and perform better in school.

3\. **Empathy and Understanding** : Showing children that you understand their
difficulties and support them in overcoming these problems fosters trust and
improves self-esteem.

## **Conclusion**

Supporting children with ADHD and ADD requires a comprehensive approach that
includes understanding their unique psychological needs, positive
reinforcement, and adapting educational and social strategies. Criticism and
coercion not only fail to help but can worsen the child’s condition. Creating
a supportive and understanding environment allows children with ADHD to
develop, achieve academic success, and improve their social skills.

When children with ADHD and ADD are deprived of parental support, they may
exhibit withdrawal behaviours, experience a decline in motivation, or resort
to substance abuse as a form of self-medication. Research indicates that
consistent parental involvement and support are critical in mitigating these
adverse outcomes. Ensuring a stable and nurturing environment helps foster
resilience, improve academic performance, and enhance social interactions,
thereby reducing the risk of negative coping mechanisms.

In my next article, I will delve deeper into the topic of self-medication
(which I do not support in any way). Together, we will explore the underlying
reasons behind this behaviour, examine its negative consequences, and discuss
effective strategies to help prevent it.
