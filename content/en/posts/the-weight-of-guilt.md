I haven’t posted in a while. Whenever I thought about writing, a familiar
feeling crept in - the heavy, suffocating weight of shame. It wasn’t just
guilt for skipping a post; it was the insidious thought that I was doing it
all over again: letting another thing slip, abandoning something I love,
proving to myself that I can’t follow through. The longer I stayed away, the
worse it got. It wasn’t just about writing anymore - it was about all the
unfinished projects, the unanswered messages, and the hobbies I once loved but
left behind. And as the shame grew, it became nearly impossible to start
again.

If you’ve ever avoided checking your emails for fear of what you might find,
or hesitated to revive an old passion because of guilt, you know exactly what
I mean. Today, let’s talk about that shame that often comes with ADHD or
trauma: why it happens, how it traps us, and most importantly, how we can
start breaking free.

## 1\. The Nature of Shame: Where It Comes From

Shame doesn’t appear out of nowhere. It’s planted, watered, and reinforced -
often from an early age.

### Early Messages and Internalisation

For many of us with ADHD (and not only), shame starts early. It might have
been a parent’s disappointed sigh when we forgot something important, or a
teacher publicly calling us out for “ _not trying hard enough._ ” These early
experiences plant the seeds of self-doubt. Over time, those external voices
become internal ones. Instead of hearing criticism from others, we begin to
criticise ourselves. The message becomes clear: “ _I’m different, I’m not
meeting expectations, and something about me isn’t right._ ”

In some cases, especially where mistakes were highlighted relentlessly,
whether in abusive or narcissistically driven environments, every small
misstep becomes proof of incompetence. You might have heard things like:

> _“Why can’t you just remember things like a normal person?”
> “You’re always so lazy.”
> “You have so much potential, but you’re just wasting it.”_

These words don’t fade away. They linger and shape our self-view, making it
hard to see that the shame wasn’t truly ours to bear; it was given to us by
people who never understood how our brains work.

### The Social Reality

When shame hits, it often feels like the whole world silently judges you. But
the truth is, most people aren’t thinking about your forgotten appointments or
missed messages. They’re busy with their own lives. Even if there is a reason
to feel ashamed, it’s important to remember that at the time, you were doing
the best you could with your resources, mental state, and past experiences.

You have two options:

- **Fix it (if possible)**

- **Learn from it and move on (if not)**

Not every relationship can be salvaged, and not every mistake can be fixed.
But the one thing that matters is that you keep going. Shame only has power if
you let it.

## 2\. The Science Behind Shame

Shame isn’t merely an emotion - it’s a physiological and neurological
response. In ADHD, this response is often more intense due to differences in
brain structure and chemistry.

### How the ADHD Brain Processes Emotions

People with ADHD don’t only struggle with attention - they also have
difficulties regulating emotions. The prefrontal cortex, which manages impulse
control, decision-making, and emotional regulation, is often wired differently
in ADHD brains. This can make it challenging to shift out of negative
emotional states [1,7,8].

The amygdala - the brain’s fear and emotion centre - is typically more
reactive in those with ADHD. This means that feelings of shame, guilt, or
embarrassment can hit harder and linger longer than they might for
neurotypical individuals. Additionally, a dopamine deficit in ADHD means that
while negative emotions register strongly, positive reinforcement doesn’t
always hit with the same intensity. In short, even a small mistake, like
forgetting an appointment, can spiral into an identity crisis: “I made a
mistake” quickly turns into “I am a failure.”

### The Body’s Response: Fight, Flight, Freeze

Shame doesn’t stay confined to the mind. It manifests physically. When
overwhelmed by shame, your nervous system can trigger a fight, flight, or
freeze response. For example, you might overcompensate by over-apologising,
avoid a situation entirely (ghosting someone or ignoring emails), or even
freeze, feeling so overwhelmed that you can’t take action. This response isn’t
a sign of moral weakness; it’s a neurological reaction meant to protect you,
even if it ends up trapping you in a cycle of inaction [2,3,5,6].

## 3\. The Shame-Avoidance Loop

Once shame sets in, it often creates a self-perpetuating cycle:

  1. **A Mistake Happens:** You miss a deadline, forget a birthday, or abandon a project you once loved.

  2. **Shame Kicks In:** Instead of seeing the mistake as an isolated event, you internalise it - “I’m unreliable. I always do this. I’ll never get it right.”

  3. **Avoidance Takes Over:** The overwhelming shame leads you to avoid the situation entirely - whether that means not rescheduling an appointment, not replying to a message, or not returning to a neglected hobby.

  4. **Avoidance Breeds More Guilt:** The longer you avoid addressing the mistake, the worse you feel, reinforcing the cycle.

  5. **The Cycle Repeats:** With each pass, shame grows, motivation fades, and the emotional storm tightens its grip.

This loop is particularly vicious for those with ADHD, where even minor
setbacks can escalate into major emotional crises.

## 4\. Breaking the Cycle of Shame

Shame loses power when it’s named, understood, and gently challenged. Instead
of fighting or avoiding it, the path forward lies in developing practical
responses: tools you can reach for when shame starts taking hold of you.

### Let Go of the Fix-It Fantasy

One of shame’s favourite lies is: “ _You must fix everything before you can
move on._ ” That’s a trap. You don’t need to reply to every missed message or
explain every lapse. You’re allowed to start fresh—right now.

**Try This:** If you've been avoiding someone, start with a simple message: “
_Hey, I’ve been meaning to reconnect—how are you?_ ” That’s enough.

### Use Emotional Exposure to Defuse Intensity

Avoiding shame makes it louder. Facing it head-on, even briefly, reduces its
grip. This isn't about reliving pain—it’s about training your nervous system
to stop panicking at the first sign of discomfort.

**Try This:** Sit with the emotion for 5 to 10 minutes. Let it rise without
distractions, just observe. You’ll likely find it peaks and then fades.

### Reframe the Story in Your Head

ADHD often turns small mistakes into sweeping judgments - “ _I missed one
deadline_ ” becomes “ _I always fail._ ” Catch that distortion and rewrite it.

**Try This:** Write the thought down, then respond as if you were comforting a
friend. It’s not about lying to yourself, it’s about being fair to yourself.

### Make Shame-Shrunken Tasks Stupidly Small

When shame makes a task feel huge, reduce it until it feels almost ridiculous.
This isn’t laziness; it’s strategy.

**Try This:** Don’t “clean the kitchen”, just rinse one dish. Don’t “clear
your inbox” - simply open one email. Once started, momentum often follows.

### Accept Without Arguing

You don’t have to justify your struggles to yourself. Radical acceptance means
acknowledging your patterns without needing to debate them.

**Try This:** “ _Yes, I forgot. Yes, I feel bad. And I can still take the next
step._ ” Shame thrives on perfectionism - cut off its fuel.

### Ditch the 'Lazy' Label

The word “lazy” is a blunt weapon used to explain what the science of ADHD
already does better: executive dysfunction. You’re not morally flawed - you’re
working with a differently wired brain.

**Reframe This:** “ _This is hard for my brain, but I can still engage with
it, one step at a time.”_

## 5\. Living Forward, One Restart at a Time

Here’s the hard truth: shame doesn’t vanish in a puff of insight. It lingers,
it mutters, and it often shows up when you least expect it - during the quiet
lull after you finish a task, when you accidentally open your inbox, or in the
stillness of bedtime reflection. The real work isn’t in making shame
disappear; it’s in learning how to live forward while it’s still sitting next
to you.

If you're struggling with shame, living forward means rewriting your
relationship with progress. It’s not linear. It’s not consistent. It’s not
clean. But it can be meaningful, and it can be yours. And that starts with
recognising what progress **actually** looks like in the context of executive
dysfunction and emotional fatigue.

**Progress is:**

- Opening the email but not replying, yet.

- Thinking about a friend you ghosted and not spiralling.

- Sitting with discomfort instead of running from it.

- Taking a break before burnout instead of after.

In other words, it’s not about flawless execution, it’s about _reconnection_.
To yourself. To your goals. To the people you care about.

But reconnection requires one thing above all: **self-trust**. And self-trust
isn’t built by making big promises—it’s built by keeping small ones. When you
tell yourself, _“I’ll just read one message,”_ and you follow through, that’s
a brick. When you say, _“I’ll show up even if it’s awkward,”_ and you do,
that’s another brick. It’s not glamorous, but it’s real. And over time, those
bricks become something solid: evidence that you can rely on yourself, even
when your brain makes it hard.

Here’s a journaling prompt I like to use—not every day, but when things feel
particularly heavy:

> _What tiny act of repair did I attempt today? What did I move toward,
> however imperfectly?_

If the answer is nothing, that’s okay. Shame will try to tell you that you’ve
failed, but the truth is, it just means you get another chance tomorrow.
You’re still allowed to try again.

Living forward doesn’t require a clean slate. It requires movement. Repeated,
messy, often reluctant, but sincere movement.

That’s what recovery from shame looks like. Not a glow-up. Just staying in the
room with your life.

## 6\. Reflection: Questions to Ask Yourself

To integrate these insights into your daily life, consider these reflective
questions:

- **When do I feel the most intense shame?** Is it after missing deadlines, forgetting people, or feeling unreliable?

- **What self-critical words do I use most often?** Are these words echoes of past criticism rather than facts?

- **Where did I learn these beliefs?** Were they given to me by others, and are they truly reflective of my worth?

- **What is one small step I can take right now?** Whether it’s opening one email or sending a brief message, choose a manageable action to move forward.

## Conclusion: It Gets Easier, But It Takes Work

Shame won’t disappear overnight. Every time when you recognise, challenge and
take even the smallest action despite it, you chip away at its power.
Remember: you are not lazy, you are not broken, and the shame you carry was
handed to you - it doesn’t define you.

Your brain is uniquely wired, with both challenges and strengths. The journey
isn’t about erasing your past; it’s about learning to live with it, accepting
it, and choosing to move forward - one small step at a time.
